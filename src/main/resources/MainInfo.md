### Analysis of Normalization:

#### **1NF (First Normal Form)**:
- **Definition**: Each column contains atomic (indivisible) values, and each row is unique.
- **Compliance**:
    - All tables have atomic values (no repeating groups or arrays).
    - Each table has a clearly defined primary key (`id`), ensuring uniqueness.

#### **2NF (Second Normal Form)**:
- **Definition**:
    - Satisfies 1NF.
    - All non-key attributes must be fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
- **Compliance**:
    - In `users`, columns (`username`, `email`, `password`) depend only on `id` (the primary key).
    - In `abouts`, `about` depends only on `id`.
    - In `details`, `name`, `gender`, and `phone_number` depend only on `id`.
    - There are no partial dependencies.

#### **3NF (Third Normal Form)**:
- **Definition**:
    - Satisfies 2NF.
    - There are no transitive dependencies (a non-key column depends on another non-key column).
- **Compliance**:
    - In all tables, every non-key column directly relates to the primary key, with no intermediate dependencies.

---

### Example of Compliance:
- In `details`:
    - `id` is the primary key.
    - `name`, `gender`, and `phone_number` are all directly related to `id`.
    - There are no transitive relationships (e.g., `phone_number` does not depend on `name` or `gender`).

### Design Strengths:
- **No Redundancy**: Information like `about` or `details` is stored in separate tables, avoiding duplication.
- **Easy Updates**: Changing a user's `username` or `email` affects only the `users` table.
- **Scalability**: The structure supports adding more related tables (e.g., addresses, user preferences) without redesigning the database.
- **Integrity**: Proper foreign key constraints ensure data consistency across relationships.

The schema satisfies **1NF, 2NF, and 3NF**, making it a well-normalized design.
